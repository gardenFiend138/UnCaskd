      <strong><h3>The Beginning</h3></strong>
      <p>
      My brother was the one to first get me into UNTAPPD, and when it
      comes down to it, the wonderful world of beer in general. I still
      remember my first few months with non-macro brews...it was nothing
      but Belgians for me! The layers of complexity, the distinct yeast
      flavor--the variety of notes that come through are remarkable. Then,
      one fine autumn day, during a brief period of time when we were
      living together, we had the idea to make a version of UNTAPPD, but
      but centered around my newfound taste for the glorious distilled
      nectar known by many names--whiskey, whisky, scotch, bourbon...

      Okay, I guess that was only four, but you get my point. Now here we
      are, years down the line, finally getting a chance to share our
      passion Now, stop reading this, and go explore the wonderful world
      of whiskies!
