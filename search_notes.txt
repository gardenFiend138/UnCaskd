searches controller, even though there's no table

top_five_results (???)- goes in each model

-look at AJ's code for his project
controller:
index, random_whiskey, whiskeys_by_rating, user whiskeys_by_name

search_params
require(:search).permit(:query, :whiskey_id, :user_id)

Whiskey.where(rating: ... )

api-music_searches > (jbuilder)

(this will be similar for each of your searches)
@whiskies.each do |whiskey|
  json.set! whiskey.id do
    json.set! :type(manually gives key of type), 'whiskey'
    json.partial! 'api/whiskies/whiskey', whiskey: whiskey
  end
end


write ajax search request within the whiskey_api_util

export const searchWhiskeyDatabase = (query) => {
  $.ajax({
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'api/whiskey_searches',
    data: { search: { query }}
  });
}
then create the action for receiving the search results, as well as the thunk action creator;

thunk action creator below will take query as an argument;
export const searchDatabase = (query)

then the search container component...definitely
look at AJ's code to see his handle
